After lose almost 3 hours trying Android Studio Github plugin, fall back to bash git.

I'm not so confident anymore. Deadline is comming... :(

The goal #1 is done: File package defined.

The next step: Android UI to create a Time Photo

(I need a little break. Get some coffe and about 15 minutes of Blade Runner old movie...)
