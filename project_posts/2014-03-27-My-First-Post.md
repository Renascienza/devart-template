##Project Journal

Rio de Janeiro, GMT 21:34:00

I get aware of DevART just today on the morning. I thought it would hold something start a trial under these conditions: the deadline to complete the project runs out tomorrow, 18:00 GMT.

This gives me less than 20 hours to close the project.

I understand that 20 hours is not enough to do anything. :/

But the definition of a project is an effort that aims a result and even a failure is a result. Let's get some coffe and make this attempt.

Let's start considering the first objective: definition of the file format.

I hope to report my findings every two hours.
