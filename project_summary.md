## Description
Memory of Droid

<i>"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. 
Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. 
I watched c-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannh√§user Gate. 
All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die."</i>

					Roy Batty (intepreted by Rutger Hauer), Blade Runner.
					
It is a sad truth that an event in time, once experienced, can never be recovered again. 
This does not happen with the space, with places. If you see a beautiful landscape somewhere, you can return tomorrow to see a similar following. But that exact landscape today will never be seen again. Time is like water: impossible to hold hands, slips through our fingers and never comes back. 

It's a shame that he let lose, is not it? 

Open your Google Maps and search for: "Trafalgar Square" or "Copacabana Beach". A first-person view is immediately at your fingertips. 

Try it now: "Trafalgar Square, in 1998." No, unfortunately, this version of the square is lost forever. 

We can take an artistic photo destined to walk through time? Could a spectator watching a picture that contains the sum of the moments from somewhere? 

Our project attempts to answer this question.

"Memory of Droid" should use mobile technology to meet four objectives :

1. Establish a packet format that allows registering images through time. The meta- information involved are the exact point in space where images was taken, its direction, his straight rise, the exact time of each image. Should be allowed to add new images and new times in the package, assuming that their spatial coordinates are the same.

2 . Develop an activity able to create and edit these packages.

3 . Develop a viewer capable of displaying the progression of images through time . A timer configurable conversion should be able to turn years in hours , days, minutes, hours in seconds . It should be possible to go forward in time or backward.

4 . The photos must be a temporal art form that takes place socially. They should be available in a cloud so that any volunteer can contribute to a further reference to the same photo.

This project, presented to DevArt , intends to meet ( in record time ! ) The first three goals.

##Project Journal

Rio de Janeiro, GMT 21:34:00

I get aware of DevART just today on the morning. I thought it would hold something start a trial under these conditions: the deadline to complete the project runs out tomorrow, 18:00 GMT.

This gives me less than 20 hours to close the project.

I understand that 20 hours is not enough to do anything. :/

But the definition of a project is an effort that aims a result and even a failure is a result. Let's get some coffe and make this attempt.

Let's start considering the first objective: definition of the file format.

I hope to report my findings every two hours.
